    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "The objective of this project is to take an input image and generate a sentence that aptly describes it.Based on this we know our architecture must be designed using the  concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks(which serves as an encoder) and a Recurrent Neural network(which serves as a decoder).The RNN will take the features generated by the CNN as an input and use that to generate the caption.This is similar to the architecutre used in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf)\n",
    "There is a variety of architectures for the encoder,however as mentioned in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYth6EbBUqM&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF&index=16&t=0s),we decided to use the resnet architecure.Henceforth no changes were made in the encoder part of the provided code.\n",
    "As RNNs are not suitable for dealing with scenarios prone to long term dependenices(as mentioned in https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf) ,we decide to use the LSTM as our decoder.\n",
    "To improve the performance of the decoder,the weights of the LSTM were initialized in accordance with the Xavier principle,and the forget gate bias was set to 1.This tends to make the LSTM almost at par with other RNN architecutres used in sequence modelling as discussed in https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/324f/c9c732116fa81624faad07524039f193cede.pdf).\n",
    "A final note about the network architecture is that after the LSTM computes the output,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf proposed two techniques for making inferences,we have decided to use sampling based approach).\n",
    "Hyperparameters:\n",
    "The embeding size,size of the hidden layer,frequency of occurence of words,learning rate,batch size and number of epochs for which the architecutre was trained are all set in accordance with the discussions in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf, https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/324f/c9c732116fa81624faad07524039f193cede.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf.\n",
    "Final note:\n",
    "It's my own inference,that the algorithm can be significantly improved if the learning rate was set to high value say 0.005 and vocab_thresh was low as compared to the one mentioned in the above references.\n",

    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** the transform was kept as it is,because\n",
    "1)the images in the dataset have varying widths and heights,to ensure that all images have same size,we need to resize them\n",
    "2)The resnet input dimensions are of 224x224x(no of channels),so we need to crop our resized image to satisfy the constraint\n",
    "3)For sake of efficiency,we also need to normalize the features.\n",
    "The transforms provided to us already accomplish these tasks,and hence there was no need to make any additional modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Since we are using the pretrained resnet model as our encoder,the encoder doesn't have any trainable parameters,\n",
    "the only parameters that need to be trained our those corresponding to the LSTM and the embedding layer.The no of trainable params are given by\n",
    "params=list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters())\n",
    "Notice that when we train the architecture,it is crucial that first we must ensure that lstm agrees on a reasonable model and then after that,if need be we can fine tune the encoder.Doing both simultaneously,will result in the updates made in the gradient by the lSTM to be propgated to the encoder,which in turn will have a negative impact[1].\n",
    "6)Show and tell:lessons learned from ms coco challenge(section 5.2 onwards)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The optimizer used for this architecure was the ADAM (as used in [2]).\n",

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "## Step 3: (Optional) Validate your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
